//Both music files loop continuously

//SFX is labeled generically, and can be mixed/matched how you see fit. You don't even have to use all of it!

//Bonks are for things hitting a wall (player and objects)
//ObjectPush and PlayerWalk both loop, so as long as an object is moving/player is walking the sound can play
//PlayerGrab_Release is the sound for when the character grabs AND releases an object
//UI_Hover is for when the mouse hovers over a button

//This is all I can do for now. There is a chance that I can get home early from work but I misread the times and so most likely this will be it for sound on my end. SOrry that I didn't get to a happy version of the song!
